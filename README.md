    This is my personal portfolio project built with Django and styled using Tailwind CSS. It uses GitHub Actions for continuous deployment and is containerized with Docker. The project was greatly inspired by Tania — you can check out her site here: <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/">https://www.taniarascia.com/</a>.
